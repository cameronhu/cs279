# Stanford CS279 - Computational Biology: Structure and Organization of Biomolecules and Cells

Set of projects performed for the computational biology course at Stanford. An overview of some of the projects undertaken include developing a PyMOL script for analyses of Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) for any PDB structure, developing a stochastic diffuser for analysis of Brownian motion of atoms, and a implementation of a Rosetta scoring function for analysis of the most optimal generated predicted protein structure.
